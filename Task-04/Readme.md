# TASK 04: The Web Developer's Blueprint
Using the div-it-up repository as your guide

# Objectives:

Successfully complete the following two core assignments:
1-js-basics: Build a strong foundation by mastering the fundamentals of JavaScript.
3-typing-game: Apply your new skills to create a fun, interactive browser-based game.

I have completed the two core assignments in div-it-up

In 1-js-basics , I have learnt js basics and did some coding practice on that 
In 3-typing-game, I learned how HTML, CSS, and JavaScript can be used together to create websites and games. I created a simple keyboard typing game where alphabets come from top to bottom, and if we click the correct alphabet, we get 1 point.

# Development Cycle
he development cycle begins with creating a Software Requirements Specification (SRS) document, which outlines the project's requirements and goals. While creating a comprehensive SRS document is beyond the scope of this curriculum, you will create a much smaller version here.
Next, detailed visual designs are developed using Figma, focusing on the look and feel (UI and UX) of the website.
Following this, front-end and back-end development is carried out, with the front-end handling the user interface and the back-end managing data and server logic.
Finally, both are integrated to ensure seamless interaction between the user interface and the underlying systems.
