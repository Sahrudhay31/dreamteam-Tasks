For the shopping cart, First I need to manage the data for the products, users, and cart itself.

# PRODUCT DATA:
product: A object to represent an individual item fot sale
For a products there will be product_id,name,price,description,image_url,stock_quantity,manufactured_and_expiry_dates.
product_id: This contains either String or Integer data type.A unique Identifier. A string is flexible for alphanumeric IDs, while an integer is efficient for indexing.

name:The product's name.A string data type is the only way to store this.

description: A Detailed description of the product.String Data type.

price:Decimal or float data type.The cost of the product

image_url: The url for the product's image.String datatype

stock_quanity:The number of items available.Integer Data type is used.

manufactured_and_expiry_dates: A string datatype is used because it contains slashes so string is better.Product's manfactured date and expiry date will be represented

# SHOPPING CART DATA:
It contains the different type of products which we added to the cart. It contains cartItem,ShoppingCart,

CartItem: A custom object for an item within the cart and it contains product_id and quantity.
product_id (string/integer): A reference to the product. The type must match the product_id from the Product data type.

quantity (integer): How many of this item are in the cart. An integer is the correct data type.

ShoppingCart: The main cart object that holds a collection of items. It contains cart_id,user_id and items
cart_id (string/integer): A unique identifier for the cart.
user_id (string/integer): Links the cart to a specific user. The type should match the user's ID.
items (list/array of CartItem objects): A collection to hold all the CartItems. This allows the cart to contain multiple different products.

# User Data:
It contains the data of the user with the credentials like mail or phone number and password.This is unique for everyone.

User: An object to represent a customer.

user_id (string/integer): A unique ID for the user.

username (string): The user's login name.

email (string): The user's email address.

address (string): The user's shipping address. A string is sufficient to store a complete address.

is_logged_in (boolean): A true/false value to check if the user is authenticated.

# Identifiers: I chose strings or integers for IDs because they need to be unique and searchable. While both work, strings are useful for complex identifiers (like UUIDs), while integers are efficient for simple, sequential IDs.

# Pricing: Using a decimal type for prices is crucial for avoiding rounding errors

# State: A boolean is the most efficient and clear data type to represent a simple true/false state, such as whether a user is logged in.
