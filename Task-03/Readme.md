# TASK 03: The Developer's Keyboard â€“ MonkeyType Challenge\
A developer's most fundamental tool is the keyboard. The ability to type quickly and accurately is not a trivial skill; it directly boosts productivity, reduces typos, and makes you more efficient when coding or working in the command line. This task is designed to help you build that foundational muscle memory.
### Objective:
Achieve a consistent typing speed of at least 45 WPM with a minimum 85% accuracy.
Focus on gradual improvement and building a habit of consistent practice, not just reaching a single high score.

### Observations:
I praticed daily 30 sec and 1 min coding practices. I am sure that  I can type above 45 wpm and with above 80 % accuracy.
