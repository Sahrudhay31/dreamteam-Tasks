## CLI & Git Mastery: Bandit, Git Exercises, and Learn Git Branching
# Bandit Walkthrough (Levels 0-20)
Myself almost completed upto 20 bandit levels and 10 git exercises.Very starting bandit levels and git exercises are very easy and going on it goes very harder and harder, if we stops at any level we cannot go furthur we need to clear the level.In level 8 of bandit there is a function called "grep" in level 8 it very easy to use but in the furthur level we  cannot use it properly.

Main concepts I have mastered from this task are 
Basic Branching

Creating and switching branches

Making commits on different branches

Visualizing branch history

Merging Strategies

Fast-forward merges

Three-way merges

Merge commits

Rebasing

Rebasing feature branches onto main

Interactive rebasing for clean history

Resolving rebase conflicts
